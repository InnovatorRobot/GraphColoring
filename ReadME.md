# GraphColoring

I compiled and executed this program under Ubuntu 20.04

### Dependency

For parsing and reading from xml, I have used libxml2.
So you should install this library by below command:

```sh
sudo apt install libxml2-dev
```
### Compilation

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
### Execution
```sh
./GraphColoring ../input.xml
```
